    intro:
      title: This is Dutch energy demand in 2011
      text: "In the Netherlands almost 92% of all energy is supplied by oil, natural gas and coal. Our transport system is almost entirely based on oil, heating and electricity for our houses mostly comes from natural gas and coal. Do we want it to stay that way? What do you think the Dutch Energy Mix will look like in %{end_year}? Use the %{app_name} to create your own Energy Mix, based on the quantitative model used by policy makers."

    popups:
      buildings: "More than 59% of the energy for houses, schools and offices is for heating or cooling. In houses almost 20% is for electricity, in buildings this is 40%. Will we still need this energy in %{end_year}?"
      agriculture: "Indirect energy use in agriculture in the Netherlands is relatively little. We disregard energy use for production of animal feeds imported from abroad. The Dutch greenhouses need a lot of energy. Greenhouses account for approximately 80% of all agricultural energy use. Can we change that by %{end_year}?"
      transport: "Transport by car, truck, train or inland navigation is energy intensive. The %{app_name} limits itself to domestic trasport. If we also include energy demand of international flight and shipping, this pecentage would be much higher. Will there be smarter options for transportation in %{end_year}?"
      industry: "Industry is the largest user of oil, gas and coal. Industry also provides the basis for our economy, while consuming precious natural resources. How will energy demand in industry change by %{end_year}?"

    co2_emissions:
      title: Change in CO2-emissions
      text: How will CO2 emissions change as a result of your choices here? This shows change with respect to 1990 levels.
    renewability:
      title: Renewable energy
      text: Which part of future energy use will be renewable? This uses the European definition of renewable energy. This means we consider what percentage of final energy use is renewable.
    footprint:
      title: Bio-footprint
      text: How much arable land is needed as a result of your choices here? Biomass of ten needs to be grown. This shows how many times the total area of Dutch arable land is required.
    energy_import:
      title: Import dependence
      text: "How much energy do the Netherlands import as a result of your choices here? This shows what percentage of energy used is imported, after subtracting exported energy. Dutch gas reserves are steadily declining, leading to a steadily rising import dependence."

  scenario_steps:
    total_amount:
      step_0: "This mix is cheaper than in 2011. A good thing, as we already spend so much on energy."
      step_1: "This mix is a little more expensive, but if our economy keeps growing, we will probably be able to afford this."
      step_2: "This mix is considerably more expensive. Will be still be able to afford this in %{end_year}?"
      step_3: "This mix is much more expensive. Will we be able to grow our way out of this predicament or be unable to afford this?"
    co2_emissions:
      step_0: "CO2 emissions of this mix are quite low. We are well on track to making our international reduction targets."
      step_1: "CO2 emissions will decrease and the Netherlands are contributing to a gobal reduction in greenhouse gases. Will it be enough though?"
      step_2: "CO2 emissions will grow just like they have in the past years. What about global warming?"
      step_3: "CO2 emissions will increase strongly. The economy is all people care about. What about our climate?"
    renewables:
      step_0: "We remain addicted to fossil fuels and are unable to harness renewable energy sources. Maybe we will not need them anyway."
      step_1: "We are making slow progress in creating a better balance between fossil and renewable energy, but cannot be said to be in a hurry."
      step_2: "In %{end_year} we will still not make the renewable energy targets our country has set itself in 2011 for 2020!"
      step_3: "Our energy transition is starting to get going and we are growing more conscious of the way we use energy. A significant share of our energy use in %{end_year} comes from renewable sources."
      step_4: "More than 50% of our energy needs are met by renewable sources!"
    footprint:
      step_0: "We will use about the same amount of biomass as we did in 2011. Quite a lot actually."
      step_1: "We will use ever more arable land and natural resources for the production of biomass."
      step_2: "Biomass use will grow strongly. Where will the required arable land and natural resources come from to grow all this biomass?"
    energy_import:
      step_0: "Although our own natural gas reserves will be depleted in %{end_year} we will manage to limit dependence on foreign energy quite well."
      step_1: "Our natural gas reservers are steadily being depleted, leading to increased imports. In %{end_year} we will import a large share of our energy demand."
      step_2: "Although our natural gas reserves are steadily being depleted, we happily continue consuming and producing. We import over 90% of our energy demand."
